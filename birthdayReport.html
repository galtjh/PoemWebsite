      This year, my birthday came in the middle of my exams. So I have partially <br>
      celebrated my birthday in advance at Munirka. I received lots of cards and
      gifts from all my cousins at Munirka.<br>
      My exams started on Monday (November 2023). and finished today.<br> <br>

      On my birthday, my mother gave me â‚¹30 to buy some chilli potatos from my school canteen. My best friend, Anges, <br>
      gave me a <b><i>Diary of a Wimpy Kid Book</i></b> which I loved. BTW my other best friend Sara said she's going to <br>
      her village on Friday and is going to bring a gift from there for me.

      In the evening, when I returned home I studied for 6 hours. All my friends in TTH had moved out so I had to celebrate my <br>
      birthday alone. I got no presents on that day but we brought the next day. My father is going to give me 2 books about coding as soon as it             arrives from <b>Amazon</b>.
